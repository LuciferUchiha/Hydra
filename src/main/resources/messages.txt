Hello mortal I am Hydra!
You can not kill me!
Hail Hydra!
My heads will always grow back!
Keep going it won't change a thing!
You stand no chance against me!
This is getting boring!
Cut off one of my heads and two will grow in its place!
You'll need help if you want to kill me!
The more heads you cut off the more heads will grow back!
For each head two will grow in its place!
Try doing something different!
You mortals are weak!
Give up! You can not defeat me!
Do you not get it? If you cut off one head more will grow back!
Guess who's back!
